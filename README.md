# Workout Generator - Bulbuc Razvan 2B2, Radu-Barb Claudiu(?) 2B2  
Regarding the teamwork, or lack thereof, at the bottom of the readme.  
  
Utilization guide  
The content of the repository, mainly the "app" and "public" folders, must be placed in a folder named "project", which will then be placed in whatever directory XAMPP reads projects from. The root directory of the project HAS to be "public", else it won't work.

While the project does have a MVC structure in place, it is currently not utilized. The only controller in use is the "home" controller, and all it does is call the views of the project. I haven't done the proper structure yet, as I don't yet know how it will look like when I start implementing the back-end.

To access the homepage, access "localhost:[port]/project/public" in a browser. This will direct you to the welcome page for users that are not logged in. From here you can go to the About page, which is still a WIP, to the Scholarly HTML technical report, or to the login page. You can get to the register page from the login page. The navigation bar all throughout changes to a dropdown menu for smaller screens, and all the navigation links from the navigation bar move into the dropdown menu.  

To access the rest of the website, please go to the Login page and hit the Login button. This will redirect you to the home page for signed in users.  

This homepage acts as a portal to other pages of interest, and as a statistics page for the user. More bubbles with statistics may be added in the future if I think of new ones.
Nevertheless, you can access every other page of the website from this homepage. Most buttons that redirect to other pages are functional. The buttons from the "Add Exercise" dropdown menu aren't, but you can get to those pages from other places in the website.  You can get back to the welcome page for unsigned users by pressing the "Logout" button from the profile icon dropdown menu.

I passed all the CSS code through CSS Lint and found no errors. The PHP files were also passed through the HTML validator, and there were no major errors besides those created because of PHP syntax.  

Finally, regarding the teamwork. I(Bulbuc Razvan), and my teammate, Claudiu, teamed up before the projects were listed. We didn't do anything the first few weeks since we registered for our project, but decided to start working on Friday, 2nd April. Because of unexpected personal issues, I wasn't able to work that day, and started on the next day instead, a saturday. I messaged Claudiu that evening, informing him of what I had done that day(the welcome page and navigation bar), and asking him his opinion on it. He didn't respond until Monday evening, saying he had been busy with exams and that he would start the next day. I messaged him on Wednesday asking if he had done anything, to which he answered he "tried but couldn't quite get it". I already had about 60% of the project done by that point, so I offered to let him do a part of what's remaining, provided he started working that day and showed me some results. He said he couldn't do it since he had an exam coming, so I completed the rest of the project by myself. The next time he messaged me was on Saturday afternoon, 11th April, asking me to let him do some work on the project; when I answered I had completed most of the project, he said he'd speak with you about it, and ask if he can get a project for himself. I figured I should write down my side of the story here, as a prerequisite to the next paragraph.

I have read that I can get penalized for 2 points if I work alone on the project, and while I technically did work alone, I did it out of necessity, and not because I wanted to. I didn't know there would be such problems when I teamed up with Claudiu, and was fully intent on co-operating. Therefore, I ask not to be penalized for working alone.
