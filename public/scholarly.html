                <p>
                    This report has the purpose of describing the first release of Workout Generator - an application to generate and keep track of personal
                    workouts. All technical aspects of the application will be covered in this report.

                <p>
                    This report is meant for anyone interested in the application. The "Overall Description" section is suitable for everyone as a brief
                    introduction to the project. Developers are invited to read the "External Interface Requirements" section for a detailed look on how 
                    the application was implemented. Users might be interested in reading about all the features of the website in the "System Features"
                    section.

                <h3> 1.4 Product Scope </h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of the application is simple -- provide the ability for users to generate and keep track of their workouts in a simplistic, easy
                    to use interface. It has been proven that exercise variety is essential to optimal muscle growth. If a person performs the same exercises over 
                    longer periods of time, the muscles will get used to that particular range of motion, and the parts of the muscles being underutilized in the exercised
                    will be left behind. Therefore, we provide workouts generated based on the user's height, weight, age, and preferences to eliminate the aforementioned
                    constraint. To keep the users maximally engaged with the application, we have also provided a workout tracker and a service to run each workout, so the users
                    have no reason or incentive to look for other applications that provide these services. This way, we run less risk of users finding other applications
                    that also provide our main feature - generated workouts - and that may appeal to them more.

                <p>
                    The application is created as a project for the Web Technologies course of the Computer Science Faculty of Alexandru Ioan Cuza University.
                    As such, it is a new, stand-alone application with no external ties or requirements.

                <p>
                    Since this project is rather simple and singular in overall functionality, we expect only a single class of users to use the application - people
                    who want to exercise. Evidently, this class of users, being the only one, will have access to all the features of the application.

                    Since this is a web application, it will run on any device with a web browser. Presumably, it will most usually be used by people on their phones during, before, 
                    or after workouts.

                <p>
                    The application was written primarily in PHP, HTML and CSS. Therefore, there should be no constraints for developers proficient in these languages.

                    The only documentation for the software will be provided in the main README file of its GitHub repository. For general users, however, there is a dedicated
                    "About" page on the website that contains information about the main features of the application.

                <p>
                    As this is a web application, the user interface is styled with CSS. As such, there are no external requirements. However, the GUI does, generally, follow a 
                    hand-made standard. A page is made of 3 areas - the navigation bar area at the top, the main area in the middle, and the footer area at the bottom. The colour
                    palette that must be followed is black background with dark red accents.

                    This web application is built with the help of XAMPP. Therefore, the language used for the back-end is PHP, the Database Management System
                    is MariaDB, and HTTP server is Apache. No libraries or frameworks for any of CSS, JavaScript or PHP are used.

                <p>
                    This is the main feature of the application. Users can generate workouts based on the spacial location of the exercises, of the muscle groups worked,
                    and exercise duration. The application also takes into account the user's age, gender, height, and weight to generate exercises of appropriate difficulty and length.
                    Alternatively, users can create their own workouts by adding exercises from the application's database.

                    The application will keep track of the user's current day streak of performing workouts, of the longest streak and of the total completed workouts. The global classments can be
                    filtered by any of these statistics. The application will also keep a history of recently completed workouts that the user can view, and perform from the same page if desired.
